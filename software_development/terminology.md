## programming languages 
some features for programming languages:
1. procedural : procedures (functions) are stitched together to form a program
2. imperative : functions are built out of statements which are generally phrased as imperative commands
3. modular : programs are made up of packages, which are made up of files.
4. object-oriented
5. statically-typed
6. garbage-collected
6. compiled: compiler takes the source code and translate it into machine language before execution.

## general
1. `statment` : sequence of instructions.
2.  `expression` :  the computation of a value by applying `operators` and `functions` to `operands`.


## functions
1. parameters: vars in between parcanteces when you `define` the function.
2. arguments: vars inside parantheces when you `call` the function.
