# Object Oriented Programming

## some types of oop to look at:

- object oriented modular programming
- incremental programming

## intro 

- structures (classes) is a collection of variables of possibly different types.
- an object is in instance of the structure, we can call it a structure itself.
- structures can be memberes of another structures
- you `can't` the `same` structure type as member of the `same` type.

    ```c++
        // c++
        struct MyStruct {
            int x;
            MyStruct y; // this is wrong
        }
    ```
