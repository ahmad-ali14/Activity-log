# Agile process
- Working software is a key aspect of Agile.
- hacking: getting the things work without propper pre-planning.
- software development is all about iterations, if you succeed or failed this week does not mean that the things will be the same next week. so we need to be adaptable.

##  Agile Manifesto
- team of developers gathered to come up with better ways to manage the process of producing great software.
- They established four core value statements about what is most important in software development. To further expand on the core values, the Alliance also agreed on 12 supporting principles.
- the 4 core values:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding to change over following a plan.
  
- from these 4 core vluaes we can say:
  - Your developers and clients will be more productive and effective in a collaborative relationship.
  - You need to facilitate communication between the people wanting the product and the people producing the product.
  - documentation should still be created constantly throughout the project. But when tough choices have to be made, a piece of working software is a lot more valuable than a document that outlines what the software should do.
  - you need to foster a positive relationship with your customer that is more concerned with what they want and not as concerned with what is laid out in some contract.
  - The client is the center of design and it is important to make sure that their vision is what is being developed.
  - Software is constantly changing and it is important to develop your software in such a way that changes are easy to respond to.
 
## Agile 12 principles:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.
5. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
6. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference to the shorter timescale.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

## good ways to make your software product more change friendly
1. Frequent client communication. 
2. Neat, commented source code. 
3. Continuously reviewing and improving your project. 
4. Updated, prioritized list of features.
5. Development team that is open to change.
