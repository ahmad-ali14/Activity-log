## packages I dealed with
- `configStore`: store your configurations in one object easly.
- `colors`: add colors to the console.
- `inquirer`: interact with users through your cli.

## commands:
- `npm link`: install the cli that  you are working on it globally on your machine.

## notes for the record:
- to grap key from user command in your cli, use `proccess.argv` witch gives you an `array` and your first arg is at index `2`.
- useful number formatter (espesially for currency)


            ```javascript
                        /**
                         * initializing currency formatter
                         */
                        const formatter = Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
                            style: 'currency',
                            currency: 'GBP'
                        })
             ```
