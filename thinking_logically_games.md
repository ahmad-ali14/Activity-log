These interactive puzzles are taken from the [Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics). They are optional, but we strongly encourage you to solve them: they will help you to "invent" the key algorithmic ideas on your own and will help you to solve the programming challenges. Even if you fail to solve some puzzles, the time will not be lost as you will better appreciate the beauty and power of the underlying ideas.
